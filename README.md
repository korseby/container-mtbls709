## Description
In this repository we present code for the study "Chemical diversity and classification of secondary metabolites in nine bryophyte species". This repository includes all code that is necessary to reproduce the results of the study based of the representative dataset published in MetaboLights as identifier MTBLS709. Quality Control (QC) was performed with mzQuality and code can be found in the repo of that project [2].

In the study we explore the influence of seasonal variations on the chemodiversity of secondary metabolites in nine bryophyte species. We present an innovative interdisciplinary methodological framework that combines a data-dependent acquisition UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS analytical method with the automated in silico classification of fragment peaks of the most abundant chemical entities into compound classes. Hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, dbRDA and ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD were used to determine relationships across species, seasons and ecological characteristics.
